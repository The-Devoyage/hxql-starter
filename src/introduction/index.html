  <h2>Build dynamic apps powered by htmx, subraph, and graphql.</h2>
  <p>Near zero boilerplate. Focus on your app, not the setup.</p>
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Dynamic Content Loading</li>
    <li><em>Recursive</em> Directory Routing</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically serve any file from the SSR or Assets Directory, defined in `api.toml`.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Ex: File located at `/src/blog/index.html` can be accessed at `https://your-site.com/blog`</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Access a folder that does not exist will trigger a recursive search for the closest match.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Recursive routing allows you to use parent directories as templates, rather than having to define repetitive
          code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ex: Accessing Non Existent Directory `/src/blog/my-first-post` will return the closed match,
          `/src/blog/index.html`
        </li>
        <li>
          In this example, the `index.html` file in the `blog` directory will be used as a template for the
          `my-first-post`.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Public GraphQL API</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Define your API in `api.toml` and access it at `https://your-site.com/playground` or
        `https://your-site.com/graphql`</li>
      <li>This configuration is used with Subgraph, a powerful tool to create dynamic APIs that connect to various data
        sources.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Handlebars Templating</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In combination with subgraph and htmx, handlebars allows you to create dynamic content with ease.</li>
      <li>Simply pass a query to the `hx-vals` property and data from your API is automatically available in your
        template.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
